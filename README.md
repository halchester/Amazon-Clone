# Amazon Clone

This is just a clone of Amazon using React JS and firebase cloud functions. I don't have a blaze plan on firebase so, to run the backend (functions folder), go into functions and run : `firebase emulators:start`

That will deploy the backend in your local host.
Without deploying firebase function, the payment won't go through.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
